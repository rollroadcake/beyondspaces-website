COM_AKEEBA_CONFIG_ADVANCED_SBBD_LABEL="Disable step break between domains"

COM_AKEEBA_CONFIG_ADVANCED_SBPA_DESC="Akeeba Backup will break the processing step if it thinks that it will run out of time before it archives a file.

However, this may result to timeout or Internal Server errors."
COM_AKEEBA_CONFIG_ADVANCED_SBPA_LABEL="Disable proactive step breaking"
COM_AKEEBA_CONFIG_ADVANCED_SBPP_DESC="Akeeba Backup will break the processing step between sub-steps of the backup finalisation and post-processing.

COM_AKEEBA_CONFIG_ADVANCED_SETMEMLIMIT_DESC="Tells Akeeba Backup to try and increase PHP's memory limit to a ridiculously high value (16Gb). This allows you to compress larger files and upload larger backup archives using memory-heavy remote storage options such as WebDAV. Note: this only sets the limit for the maximum memory consumption. In most cases, Akeeba Backup's backup engine consumes <em>far less</em> memory than that, typically in the low 20Mb area. Compressing and uploading larger files also requires changing other options in the backup profile's Configuration page."

COM_AKEEBA_CONFIG_UPLOADKICKSTART_DESCRIPTION="When checked a copy of Akeeba Kickstart Professional will be uploaded to the remote storage specified in the Post-processing Engine above (except for the None and Email engines).
